# Data-Analysis-Using-MS-Excel
In this repo, I have analysed the local store data and prepared an annual report of 2022. Based on which I have proposed sample insights to this data
By analyzing the data through Excel weâ€™ll be able to give the answers to the following questions-
Q1-> Compare the sales and orders using single chart.
Q2-> Which month got highest sales and orders?
Q3-> Who purchased more men or women in 2022?
Q4-> What are the different order status in 2022?
Q5-> List top 10 states contributing to the sales?
Q6-> Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
Q7-> Highest selling category? Etc.


For further details check out the report and excel file attached in the repositories.


Thanks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
